# Face Detection and Recognition System 🧑🔍

A simple yet powerful system for detecting and recognizing faces in images, built using Python. This project demonstrates facial detection, recognition, and annotation, with scalability for future enhancements.

---

## Features 🚀

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces within images. 🔎  
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a pre-established database to identify individuals. 👤  
- **Annotation**: Labels recognized faces with rectangles and their corresponding names. 🏷️  
- **Scalability**: Designed with future enhancements in mind, including video file processing. 📈

## Installation 💻

To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, set up the required libraries using the following command:  

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python

Usage 🛠️
1. Add your image(s) in the project directory.
2. Run the script to process the images for detection and recognition.
3. The processed image will be stored as result.jpg in the project's root directory, complete with labeled rectangles around each recognized face.

Output 🖼️
The output image (result.jpg) will look like this:

1. Detected faces are outlined with rectangles.
2. Recognized faces are labeled with their names.
